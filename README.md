### Features of Angular 1

	1. MVC architecture being truly followed

	2. Declarative user interface

	3. Dependency Injection

	4. Functional Directives

	5. Flexible utilisation of filters

	6. No need to write unnecessary codes

	7. Proper DOM manipulations

	8. Proper service providers

	9. Context aware communication

	10. Pre-developed unit testing

Despite all the above mentioned features still Angular JS alone would not be able to solve all the challenges posed by modern technical requirements. For example if you demand a gaming or a mathematical computation program then Angular JS might not be able to successfully serve you. However, it is very much effective to solve the problems based upon the field of generic web applications

### Role of Angular 2

The advantages of Angular2 include:

	1. Usage of TypeScript

	2. Giving support to web components

	3. Great performance

	4. Simplified interface

	5. Ability to complete large scale projects


### Angular 2 and Typescript

One of the major advantages of Angular 2 is that it could easily work with both TypeScript and JS whereas Angular JS could only perform with JavaScript. The official website of Angular 2 incorporates the documentation of TypeScript. For this reason, one should know the advantages of TypeScript.


### Features of TypeScript

1. TypeScript combines various characteristics of JS that helps it to solve the long-term projects.

2. It offers support for interfaces and inheritance that will facilitate code decoupling and its reuse.

3. Provides static and complied time checking
